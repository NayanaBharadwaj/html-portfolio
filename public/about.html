<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a cool, optimistic girl who always find some reason to be happy, also I want to be the reason for 
  someone's happiness. I believe that I am strong enough to face any challenge in life. 
  I always wanted to be an independent woman and am becoming one. I am proud of myself and have no regrets in life.
</p>

<p>I am a graduating student. Right now I am staying in Newcastle city, UK. Life was good when I was still
  a student, but it's not bad now either. I have recently got a part-time job, but not getting enough
  shifts. I am trying my life hard to survive here, which is quite making me happy. By this I realized that
  I have always celebrated my results lil more only if I put enough efforts. 
</p>

<p>Now, I am concentrating on full-time job. I will start applying for jobs from tomorrow, which is 
  16th September. My CV looks quite impressive. I hope I get a job ASAP so that I can have my parents 
  over here and show them the city with my money. After all, everything I do is to see their happiness!
